Rolling Horizon Signal Accumulation Strategy (Baseline)

Objective
	•	Test whether LLM-extracted bullish / bearish signals from research articles can be converted into a simple, systematic trading framework for commodity futures.

⸻

Signal Construction
	•	Each research article is parsed by LLM into:
	•	Asset (commodity future)
	•	Direction: bullish (+1) or bearish (−1)
	•	Forecast horizon: [t_{start}, t_{end}]

⸻

Horizon Normalization
	•	To avoid long-dated signals mechanically dominating exposure:
	•	Each signal is assigned a unit total weight
	•	Daily contribution is evenly distributed across its forecast horizon
	•	For a signal with horizon length H days:
	•	Daily weight = +1 / H (bullish) or −1 / H (bearish)

⸻

Position Aggregation
	•	On each trading day:
	•	Identify all active signals (current date ∈ forecast horizon)
	•	Sum daily weights across all active signals to obtain raw position
	•	Net position reflects accumulated directional conviction from research articles

⸻

Risk Control
	•	Apply a hard position cap to prevent excessive exposure:
	•	Position ∈ [−1, +1]
	•	No leverage, no volatility scaling, no dynamic risk optimization

⸻

Execution Assumptions
	•	Simple, conservative execution to isolate signal quality:
	•	Trade at next-day open (or close)
	•	Fixed notional exposure
	•	No intraday timing or execution optimization

⸻

Key Design Principles
	•	Emphasis on transparency and explainability
	•	Avoid parameter tuning and overfitting
	•	Framework designed as a research baseline, not a production strategy

⸻

Expected Outcome / Interpretation
	•	Strategy tests structural signal quality, not trading sophistication
	•	Suitable for evaluating whether article-derived signals:
	•	Carry standalone alpha, or
	•	Are better used as contextual / supporting inputs to other strategies

⸻

Known Limitations
	•	Ignores regime dependency and conditional language in research articles
	•	Treats all signals as equally reliable
	•	Does not account for signal interaction or macro context

⸻

Conclusion
	•	Provides a clean, conservative baseline to assess the feasibility of trading LLM-extracted research signals
	•	Negative or weak results indicate structural limitations, not implementation issues
	•	Helps determine whether further investment in this direction is justified
